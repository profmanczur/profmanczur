## Welcome?

**profmanczur/profmanczur** is a  _special_ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am a professor of computer science at Passaic County Community College.
I studied computational forensic linguistics and am interested in research for automatic validity detection for confessions. 
Iâ€™m currently learning NOSQL database systems and reworking the Database courses.

Fun Fact: I enjoy dramatic theater. The more heart-rending, the better.
